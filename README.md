An MCP server that lets Claude (or any MCP-compatible agent) view and build [Wanderlog](https://wanderlog.com) trip itineraries through conversation.

Instead of clicking through the Wanderlog UI to plan a trip, you just ask:

> *"Create a 14-day Japan Golden Route trip — Tokyo, Hakone, Kyoto, Nara, and Osaka."*

The agent calls the tools, interleaves places and notes for each day, adds hotel blocks and checklists, and you end up with a fully populated Wanderlog trip in a few minutes.

**See a real example:** [14-day Japan Golden Route](https://wanderlog.com/view/dmvegdhqsa/japan-golden-route--tokyo--hakone--kyoto--nara--osaka) — built entirely by an AI agent using this MCP server.

## What's New in v0.2.0

- `wanderlog_rename_day` — replace auto-generated day headings (e.g. `"Barcelona"`) with descriptive ones (`"Arrival — Feria de Abril"`). Pass `""` to reset back to the default.
- Tools table now documents `wanderlog_annotate_place` and `wanderlog_add_expense` (shipped previously, missing from v0.1.0 docs).

## What's New in v0.1.0

- Full itinerary building: places, notes, hotels, and checklists in a single conversation
- `wanderlog_search_places` — find real-world places near any destination using Wanderlog's place database
- `wanderlog_add_note` — interleave transit tips, booking info, and local advice between places
- `wanderlog_add_checklist` — pre-trip and per-day checklists (visa, currency, timed-entry tickets)
- MCP server instructions injected at startup so Claude builds complete itineraries automatically
- Startup auth probe — catches expired cookies immediately instead of failing mid-conversation

## Example Prompts

```
"What trips do I have in Wanderlog?"

```
```
"I'm spending 5 days in Tokyo — build me a full itinerary with museum visits, ramen spots,
and a ryokan in Shinjuku."
```
```
"Look at my Barcelona trip and add practical notes for getting between each place."
```
```
"Add a pre-trip checklist to my Paris trip — visa, currency, offline maps, travel insurance."
```
```
"Move my Rome trip back by two weeks."
```
```
"Give me the shareable link to my Kyoto itinerary."
```
```
"Remove the Colosseum from day 2 of my Rome trip."
```

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 22 or newer**
- **A [Wanderlog](https://wanderlog.com) account**
- An MCP-compatible client: Claude Code, Claude Desktop, OpenAI Codex, Cursor, VS Code, or any stdio MCP host

## Setup

### Step 1 — Get your Wanderlog session cookie

Wanderlog doesn't have a public API, so wanderlog-mcp authenticates using your browser session cookie (`connect.sid`). It's valid for roughly a year and never leaves your machine.

**Treat it like a password** — it grants the same access you have in the Wanderlog UI.

#### Chrome / Edge

1. Go to [wanderlog.com](https://wanderlog.com) and log in
2. Press `F12` to open DevTools
3. Click the **Application** tab
4. In the left sidebar expand **Storage → Cookies → https://wanderlog.com**
5. Find the row where **Name** is `connect.sid`
6. Click the row, then double-click the **Value** cell and copy the full string — it starts with `s%3A` and is ~100 characters long

#### Firefox

1. Go to [wanderlog.com](https://wanderlog.com) and log in
2. Press `F12` to open DevTools
3. Click the **Storage** tab
4. In the left sidebar expand **Cookies → https://wanderlog.com**
5. Find `connect.sid` in the table, click it, and copy the **Value**

> **Why can't I use `document.cookie` in the console?**
> Wanderlog sets `connect.sid` with the `HttpOnly` flag, which deliberately blocks JavaScript from reading it (XSS protection). DevTools bypasses this restriction — that's why it works and the console doesn't.

### Step 2 — Configure your MCP client

#### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add wanderlog-mcp npx wanderlog-mcp \
  --env WANDERLOG_COOKIE="s%3A...your value here..."
```

#### Claude Desktop

Edit `claude_desktop_config.json`:

- **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Linux:** `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "wanderlog": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["wanderlog-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "WANDERLOG_COOKIE": "s%3A...your value here..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop after saving.

#### Cursor

Settings → MCP → Add server, or edit `~/.cursor/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "wanderlog": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["wanderlog-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "WANDERLOG_COOKIE": "s%3A...your value here..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### VS Code (GitHub Copilot)

Add to your workspace `.vscode/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "wanderlog": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["wanderlog-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "WANDERLOG_COOKIE": "s%3A...your value here..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### OpenAI Codex

Edit `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
[mcp_servers.wanderlog]
command = "npx"
args = ["wanderlog-mcp"]

[mcp_servers.wanderlog.env]
WANDERLOG_COOKIE = "s%3A...your value here..."
```

Run `/mcp` inside Codex to confirm the server loaded.

#### Smithery (one-click install)

```bash
npx @smithery/cli install wanderlog-mcp --client claude
```

### Step 3 — Verify

Ask your agent: *"What trips do I have in Wanderlog?"*

It should call `wanderlog_list_trips` and return your account's trips. If it fails, see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) below.

## Refreshing your cookie

The cookie lasts about a year but can die sooner if you log out of wanderlog.com, change your password, or Wanderlog revokes the session. When that happens every tool call returns:

> **Wanderlog session invalid or expired** — Capture a fresh connect.sid cookie from wanderlog.com DevTools and update WANDERLOG_COOKIE in your MCP config.

Repeat Step 1 above, update your config, and restart your MCP client.

## Troubleshooting

**Server starts but list_trips returns an auth error**
Your cookie is expired or wrong. Re-capture it from DevTools and update your config.

**`npx wanderlog-mcp` hangs or does nothing**
The server speaks stdio MCP — it's designed to be launched by an MCP host, not run directly in a terminal. Run it through Claude Code or Claude Desktop as described above.

**Tools work but the agent ignores notes/checklists**
The server injects instructions into the MCP `initialize` response that tell the agent to interleave places and notes and add checklists. This works reliably with Claude. Other clients may vary.

## Security

wanderlog-mcp ships two transports with very different trust models. Pick
the one that matches your deployment, and read the matching subsection.

### Security — local stdio mode (`dist/index.js`, the default)

- The cookie is stored only in your MCP client config, never committed or logged
- The Node process runs entirely on your machine; there is no relay server, and
  no network egress beyond wanderlog.com itself
- The startup auth probe validates your cookie without printing its value
- To revoke access: log out of wanderlog.com (invalidates all sessions), then re-capture

### Security — HTTP transport (`dist/http.js`, e.g. fly.io)

- The HTTP server is a **multi-tenant relay**. Every request must carry
  `Authorization: Bearer <connect.sid>`; the cookie value must never be
  passed in the URL — it would land in proxy access logs and `Referer`
  headers
- Cookies are held in process memory for up to 10 minutes after last use,
  hashed (SHA-256, truncated) for cache lookup but stored in plaintext for
  outbound calls to wanderlog.com
- **Operators are trusted with every active user's cookie.** Deploy only
  behind TLS, restrict ingress, rotate any cookies you suspect were
  exposed, and assume that anyone who can read the process memory or the
  outbound traffic can act as your users on wanderlog.com
- The server is stateless across restarts; restarting evicts all cached
  cookies. There is no on-disk credential store
- Error logs route through `redactSecrets()` before reaching stdout, so
  cookies and `?token=…` query strings do not surface in fly.io logs
